ADAU1701 Projects

My interest is in stereo "stomp box" type effects using the ADAU1701.
There are many boards out there that will run these projects with litte or
no modification. Currently there are three different effects in the library.

- Distortion: This is a three stage effect that "emulates" a VOX AC-30.
This is a simplified design based on work done by Stephan MÃ¶ller.
- Phlanger: This will be a reproduction of the PAiA 1500-Phlanger.
See the docs for more information.
- Tremolo: This is a set of stereo tremolo effects.
These are original is concept and implementation. 

Any and all comments are welcome. Mostly, I hope someone finds these useful and fun.
